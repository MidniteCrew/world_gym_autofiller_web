# World Gym Autofiller — Works on any device

This website lets you create a personal bookmark that contains your information.  
When you scan the QR code at World Gym, you simply tap the bookmark and the guest form fills itself automatically.

It works well on most browsers, including Safari and Chrome.  
However, on **Firefox for iOS**, this method is unreliable due to stricter security restrictions. When running the bookmark, Firefox may refresh the page instead of executing it.
